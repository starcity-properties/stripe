# stripe-clj

A Clojure(Script) wrapper of the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api).

## Difference from `racehub/stripe-clj`

This library is forked from
[racehub/stripe-clj](https://github.com/racehub/stripe-clj), but has been
modified so substantially that it shares very little in common with the
original. Most significantly:

- Uses Clojure `spec` instead of [Schema](https://github.com/plumatic/schema)
- Is written for a much newer version of the Stripe API

## Status

This library is under active development. Not recommended for use.

## Testing

- [ ] TODO: Is this still the case?

You'll need this in your environment:

```sh
export STRIPE_SECRET="stripe_secret_token"
```

You should probably use your dev token.
